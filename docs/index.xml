      <description>Research Projects
Secret Life of Larvae CSULB, Collaborative research between Design, Biological Sciences and Biomedical Engineering
Dr. Douglas Pace, Dr. Siavash Ahrar, Dr. Behnaz Farahi
Our team will study the phenomenon of phenotypic plasticity during larval development of the Pacific sand dollar (Dendraster excentricus) from biological, engineering, and design perspectives. Phenotypic plasticity is a single organism&amp;rsquo;s ability to possess many different phenotypes based on environmental interactions. This research is motivated by the importance of phenotypic plasticity as a first response mechanism for organisms coping with climate change.</description>
