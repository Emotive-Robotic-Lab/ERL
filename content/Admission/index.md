**Applying to the Master of Arts, Human Experience Design Interactions Program: a two step process**

Prior to admittance into the MA_HXDI program, all students must first apply to, and be accepted by the University. Deadline for complete applications to the University through CSU Apply is March 15. Selected applicants, accepted through the CSUApply will be invited to submit additional application materials through an online platform. These applicants and their materials will be reviewed by the department graduate admissions committee. Through this competitive process, a cohort of approx. 12 students will be selected based on diversity of skills, experiences, and potential to perform successfully in an intensive, full-time, face-to-face design program.
 
Once admitted into the Department of Design, students will enroll in required graduate courses. Please see the MA_HXDI Flow Chart and the [CSULB Catalog](http://catalog.csulb.edu/) for specific course requirements and descriptions. For more detailed information see the [MA_HXDI policy statement](https://web.csulb.edu/divisions/academic_affairs/grad_undergrad/senate/policy/degree/numerical/19-01.html).
