**ABOUT Emotive Robotic Lab**


The Emotive Robotic Lab, led by [Dr. Behnaz Farahi](https://behnazfarahi.com/), is an innovative research lab within the CSULB Design Department. This lab specializes in integrating robotics into the field of design. It delves deeply into the realm of human-robot interaction, placing a strong emphasis on pivotal areas such as robotic fabrication, advanced digital design techniques, and the exploration of cutting-edge materials. ERL looks at materiality as an initiative for design research with a special interest in robotic fabrication including 3D printing (clay, liquid, plastic), photogrammetry, algorithmic design and AI. By conducting experiments and research in these domains, the lab seeks to advance the frontiers of design technology and foster a deeper understanding of the symbiotic relationship between humans and design of built environments.

This lab works closely with  Master of Arts in [Human Experience Design Interactions (MA_HXDI)](https://www.csulb.edu/design/article/design-now-offering-an-ma-human-experience-design-interactions-hxdi). The program will prepare students and/or returning professionals from diverse undergraduate backgrounds for advanced multidisciplinary design work in careers of their choice. Through the MA_HXDI program, students will develop expertise in the tools and methods of experience design as a strategy for making and adding value to systems, products, spaces, and services.
