As part of the REALIGNMENTS: Toward Critical Computation conference, ACADIA is pleased to offer a lineup of exciting workshops led by expert instructors from around the globe. The conference chairs have curated workshops that uniquely address the conference's theme of distributed modes of working and collaboration, including topics such as remote robotics, co-design, machine learning, and much more.

The workshops will take place September 11-12. All workshops will occur online via Zoom or similar video conferencing platform. 

Workshops are eligible for AIA Continuing Education credit. See the listings below for the credits available for each workshop.

Note about software licenses: Unless otherwise indicated in the workshop descriptions below, workshop participants are responsible for installing the required software on their personal computers and securing all necessary licenses. In most cases, software companies provide trial licenses and/or educational licenses that will be sufficient for the duration of the workshop. Please read the software requirements for each individual workshop below.
